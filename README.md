## 🏁 Final Words

We had a fun time making this code from scratch, it was a huge learning experience for a team of 2nd semester students who have never done fullstack web development before, we had days where the code was running smooth, some days where the code broke, but overall it was satisfying and is still looking forward to upgrade and enhance the project and make more in the future
